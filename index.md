# Teaching Portfolio

**Dipali Jain** · University of Texas at Dallas · STEM (ECE)

Welcome! This site hosts my **teaching portfolio** for tenure-track applications. It includes my teaching philosophy, experience, evidence of effectiveness, mentoring record, DEI contributions, and recognition.

## Teaching Philosophy (summary)
My teaching centers on **active, project-based learning** in STEM with an emphasis on inclusive pedagogy and authentic lab experiences. Students learn by building, testing, and iterating—using real hardware and contemporary AI/ML tools. I collect evidence of learning (formative + summative) and close the loop by adapting activities, rubrics, and supports.

- **Hands-on labs:** Arduino/MSP432, SPICE/Ngspice, Python/Matlab.
- **AI/ML integration:** data literacy, model reasoning, and responsible AI in ECE.
- **Inclusive assessment:** transparent rubrics, alternative demonstration pathways.
- **ABET alignment:** problem-solving, experimentation, communication, ethics.
