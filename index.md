# Teaching Portfolio

**Dipali Jain** · University of Texas at Dallas · STEM (ECE)

Welcome! This site hosts my **teaching portfolio** for tenure-track applications. It includes my teaching philosophy, experience, evidence of effectiveness, mentoring record, and DEI contributions. A concise PDF version is available in application packets; this website provides extended materials and downloadable artifacts.

## Teaching Philosophy (summary)

My teaching centers on **active, project-based learning** in STEM with an emphasis on inclusive pedagogy and authentic lab experiences. I design courses where students learn by doing—building, testing, and iterating—while connecting concepts to real hardware and contemporary AI/ML tools. I routinely collect data on student learning (formative + summative) and close the loop by adapting activities, rubrics, and support structures.

See the full statement below and details in the sections linked above.

- Encourage **hands-on labs** (Arduino/MSP432, SPICE, Python/Matlab), design sprints, and **team-based projects**.
- Integrate **AI/ML and modern tooling** to develop data/algorithmic literacy across ECE curricula.
- Scaffold **inclusive assessments** (spec-based grading options, alternative demonstration artifacts) and transparent rubrics.
- Align outcomes with **ABET** student outcomes (problem solving, experimentation, communication, ethics).
