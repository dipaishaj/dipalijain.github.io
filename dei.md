# Diversity, Equity, and Inclusion

I design for inclusion by lowering hidden curriculum barriers, building community, and giving multiple pathways to demonstrate learning.

## Inclusive Practices
- **Structured team formation** to balance backgrounds and experience.
- **Multiple demonstration pathways** (notebooks, lab videos, reflective memos).
- **Transparent rubrics** and early exemplars to reduce ambiguity.
- **Office-hour triage** and peer shout-outs to foster community.

## Wellness & Belonging
- As a **certified yoga instructor**, I occasionally integrate brief optional mindfulness/wellness micro-sessions during intense lab/exam periods to support focus and stress management, especially for first-gen and international students.

## Outreach & Service
- Organized cultural events and community clean-ups; mentored diverse students transitioning to project-based ECE courses.
