# Diversity, Equity, and Inclusion

Describe specific strategies and concrete actions you use to build inclusive learning environments in STEM.

## Inclusive Practices
- **Structured team formation** to balance experience levels and backgrounds.
- **Multiple demonstration pathways** (code notebooks, lab videos, reflective memos).
- **Transparent rubrics** and early exemplar sharing to reduce ambiguity.
- **Community-building** rituals (peer shout-outs, office-hour triage forms).

## Outreach & Service
- Organized cultural events and community clean-ups; **certified yoga instructor** leading wellness micro-sessions during exam weeks.
- Mentored **first-gen and international students** in transitioning to project-based ECE courses.
