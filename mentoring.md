# Mentoring & Advising

Highlight supervision of student projects (UG/Grad), outcomes (awards, publications, placements), and your mentoring approach.

## Selected Projects
- **Analog Circuit Security (UG Capstone):** supervised PCB prototyping + SPICE modeling → poster prize.
- **Battery Anomaly Detection for Drones:** mentored a student team on MSP432-based data collection and TinyML baseline.
- **Graph Learning for Circuits:** guided research assistants to prepare datasets and evaluation scripts.

## Outcomes
- Student co-authorships at conferences (ITC, ASP-DAC, HOST).  
- Multiple capstones completed; several students placed in **semiconductor/AI** roles.

## Mentoring Philosophy
- Set **milestone roadmaps**, maintain weekly check-ins, and use lightweight design docs.
- Emphasize **inclusive teamwork**, reflective journaling, and research integrity.
