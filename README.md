# Teaching Portfolio (GitHub Pages)

This is a ready-to-use scaffold for a **teaching portfolio** hosted on GitHub Pages.

## Quick Start
1. Copy all files into your repository (you can use `dipalijain.github.io` or a separate repo).
2. Commit & push to `main`.
3. In the repo: **Settings → Pages → Source = `Deploy from a branch` → Branch: `main`**.
4. Replace placeholder files in `/assets` with your PDFs/images:
   - `Teaching_Statement.pdf`
   - `Fundamentals_Syllabus.pdf`
   - `UTD_Fall2023_Evals.pdf`
   - `headshot_placeholder.png`
   - `eval_summary_placeholder.png`

## Customize
- Edit `_config.yml` to change theme, title, or description.
- Update the navigation links at the top of each page (already included).
- Add/rename pages as needed.

## Notes
- The Minimal theme uses `layout: default`. Each `.md` file already includes a YAML front matter block.
- Keep the **short PDF** in job applications and link to this site for extended materials.
